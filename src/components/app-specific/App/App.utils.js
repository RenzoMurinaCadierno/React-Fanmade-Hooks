  "Hey hey, welcome! Howdy doing?\n\nThanks for giving this library a shot! Everything is open source, it's a modest contribution to the awesome React environment and community.\n\nYou can check the repo using the expandable icon in home page.\n\nHowever, if you intend on using anything, it would be awesome if you link us back. That simple thing means a lot to us all! Let's spread the word! :D\n\nAnyways, hope you enjoy your stay. Do not hesitate to contact us at nmcadierno@gmail.com if you need so!\n\nHappy coding! ;)\n\n  - R.N.M.C. @ React-Fanmade-Hooks\n\nP.S.: Do not mind `setTimeout` warnings, they are taken care of internally."
